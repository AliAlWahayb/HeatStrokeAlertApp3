## Project Overview
The **HeatStroke Alert** app is designed to monitor real-time weather conditions, providing alerts when the temperature reaches dangerous levels that could lead to heatstroke. This application aims to help users stay safe by notifying them of extreme heat conditions in their location, enabling proactive steps to avoid heat-related illnesses. The app is developed as part of the mobile development course at IAU CCIT, Semester 8.

## Features
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Fetches current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other critical weather parameters.
- **Heatstroke Alerts**: Sends notifications when the temperature reaches hazardous levels (based on predefined thresholds).
- **Hourly and Daily Forecasts**: Provides hourly and daily forecasts to help users plan their day.
- **Location-Based Alerts**: Users can receive alerts based on their current location or a manually set city.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and easy-to-navigate design focused on providing key weather data at a glance.
